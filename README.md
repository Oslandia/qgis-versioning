Versioning
==========

Build and install the qgis plugin
---------------------------------

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/Oslandia/qgis-versioning.git
    cd qgis-versioning
    ./package.py # compresses all files into qgis_versioning.zip
    cd .qgis2/python/plugins/
    mkdir qgis-versioning
    cd qgis-versioning
    # unzip contents of directory *qgis_versioning* found in qgis_versioning.zip

If you have admin acces to a local postgres/postis server, you can run the regression tests:

	export QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/your/qgis/installation
    export PYTHONPATH=$QGIS_DIR/python:$PYTHONPATH
	python3 tests.py 127.0.0.1 postgres -v
	
And if you want to run only one regression test: 

	export QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/your/qgis/installation
    export PYTHONPATH=$QGIS_DIR/python:..:$PYTHONPATH
	python3 plugin_test.py 127.0.0.1 postgres

	
Use the plugin in qgis
----------------------

Check that the plugin 'qgis-versioning' is activated in the plugin manager or install the versioning plugin directly in QGIS (Menu : Plugins = Manage plugins : Versioning).

Load posgis layers from a scheme you want to version.

Group postgis layers together. Select the group and click on the 'historize' button in the plugin toolbar (make sure the toolbar is displayed). The layers will be replaced by their view in the head revision

Click on the group and then on the 'checkout' button. Choose a file to save your layers locally.

Modify your layers.

Click on the 'commit' icon.
